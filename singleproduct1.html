        <h1> Judy McGee </h1>
        <p>I am a professional life, career and executive coach who has spent 20 + years helping thousands of professionals to create success that's balanced. I started my career coaching executives at Fortune 500 companies and non-profits on public relations. I craved more personal fulfillment, so I got trained and certified as a personal life and career coach and opened my own business in 2003. I feel fortunate to have found my calling as a coach and am passionate about making a difference in other peoples' lives.</p>

        <p>I enjoy being interviewed for national and local TV shows, magazines, newspapers and blogs and I wrote a chapter on "How to Manage Your Love/Hate Relationship with Time" for the book Inspiration to Realization. I give back to the coaching profession by regularly mentoring new coaches.</p>
