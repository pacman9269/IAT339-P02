            <p>Our attendees are normally somebody who
            ...puts things off to the last minute 
            ...has trouble finding motivation in doing the things that need to get done
            ...knows what they need to do, but can't seem to follow through
            ...procrastinates a lot, but is sick of it
            ...wants to make a change. </P>

            <p>We'll go through a self-assessment on your own levels of procrastination. what is controllable, and we'll give you tons of time to get out of the hustle and grind mentality of your day-to-day activity.
